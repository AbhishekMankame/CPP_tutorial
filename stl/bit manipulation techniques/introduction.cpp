/*Bit Manipulation techniques

--> Reason why we use bitwise operator is that they operate on the binary representation of the data. 
--> It is fast as compared to non bitwise operators

==> Different types of bitwise operators are:
--> Binary AND &
--> Binary OR |
--> Binary XOR ^
--> Binary One's Complement ~
--> Binary Left Shift <<
--> Binary Right Shift >>
