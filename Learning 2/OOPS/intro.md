## ðŸ§ What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
OOP is a way to structure your code like the real world:
- You model real-world entities (objects) in code.
- These entities have properties (data) and behavoirs (functions).
- The blueprint for these entities is called a class.

### ðŸ§± 1. What is a Class?
A class is like a blueprint for an object.<br>
It defines what an object will have and what it can do.<br>
Example: Think of a Car
- Every car has properties: `brand`, `color`, `speed`
- Every car can do things: `accelerate()`, `brake()`
<br>
In C++:
<pre>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    // Data members (properties)
    string brand;
    string color;
    int speed;

    // Member function (behavior)
    void startEngine() {
        cout << "Engine started for " << brand << endl;
    }
};
</pre>
