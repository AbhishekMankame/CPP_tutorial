## The Tale of Bob and the Fibonacci Turtles
### ðŸŒ±  The Problem
Bob has a turtle farm. He notices something strange:
- In Month 1, he has 1 baby turtle.
- In Month 2, still 1 turtle.
- From Month 3 onwards, the number of turtles is the sum of turtles in the last two months.<br>
Bob: "Huh... Month 3 has 2, Month 4 has 3, Month 5 has 5... Are my turtles doing math??"<br>
This gives us the famous:
<pre> Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2) </pre>
