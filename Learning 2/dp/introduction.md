## 🧠 Meet Bob, the Lazy but Smart Guy
Imagine you're Bob, a super lazy dude who hates doing the same thing twice. But you're smart. If you ever have to solve a problem, and you know you'll see it again, you write down the answer on a sticky note and slap it on the fridge.<br>
Now, whenever you face the same problem, instead of solving it again, you just read the stick note.<br>
That's dynamic programming.
