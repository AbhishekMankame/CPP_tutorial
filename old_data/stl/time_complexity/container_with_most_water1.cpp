/*Container with most water
This is leetcode question: 11, here we are given n non-negative integers or heights in the form of an array.
Each integer represents the height of a vertical line at the position i where the width of each line is 1.
We need to find two lines, which together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container can hold the maximum water.abort
Constraints: n==height.length
            2<=n<=10^5
            0<=height[i]<=10^4
