 * @brief Introduction to Time Complexity in C++ STL
 *
 * This file provides an introduction to the concept of time complexity,
 * which is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete
 * as a function of the length of the input. Understanding time complexity
 * is crucial for writing efficient code and optimizing performance.
