/* Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. 
It is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quick sort, heap sort or merge sort.
