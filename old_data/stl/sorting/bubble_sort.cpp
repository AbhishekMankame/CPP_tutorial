// Bubble sort:
// --> Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
// --> The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
// --> The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
// --> Bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm when n is large.
// --> Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of O(N^2) when n is large.
