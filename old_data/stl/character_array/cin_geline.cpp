// cin.getline() --> cin.getline() is used to read a line of text from the input stream. It reads the characters until a newline character is encountered or the specified maximum number of characters is read.
// It also discards the newline character from the input stream. The function takes two arguements: the character array to store the input and the maximum number of characters to read.
