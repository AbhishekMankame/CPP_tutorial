## 🎢 Welcome to "GraphLand" - Where Nodes Have Feelings Too
Imagine a theme park called GraphLand, where every node (person) is trying to connect with other nodes (friends) via edges (handshakes, secrets, love letters, etc). Now let's explore the math with stories!

### 🎉 1. Handshaking Theorem:
<pre>
"If everyone in the party shakes hands, how many hands are shaken?"
</pre>
💬 The Rule:<br>
Every edge is like a secret handshake between two people. So, if we sum all the handshakes each person hand, it's double the actual number of secret handshakes!<br>
📏 Formula:
<pre>Sum of all degree = 2 x number of edges </pre>
