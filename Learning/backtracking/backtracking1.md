## ðŸŽ¬ Welcome to: "Backtracking - The Bollywood Hero of Problem Solving"
Imagine you're in a massive maze ðŸ§©. You're the hero (duh ðŸ˜Ž), and you're trying to save the princes, solve a Suduko, or place N on a chessboard without triggering alarms. Every step you take, you're like:
<pre>"Let me try this path... hmm... nope, dead end ðŸ˜‘... ok, let me backtrack and try something else!"</pre>
That's backtracking in a nutshell!

### ðŸ§  DEFINITION (a.k.a. the brainy bit):
Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that tries out all possible options and "backtracks" as soon as it realizes the current path is invalid or won't lead to the solution.<br>
ðŸ‘‰ It's basically a fancy brute force with a conscience - it doesn't go full "try everything' if it knows it's going nowhere fast.

### ðŸªœ Steps (The Backtracking Lifestyle):
1. Choose: Pick one possible choice.
2. Explore: Dive deeper assuming this was the correct choice.
3. Un-choose (BACKTRACK): If it fails, undo the choice and try the next option.
