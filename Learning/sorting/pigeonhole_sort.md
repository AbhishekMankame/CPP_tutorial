## 🐦✨What is Pigeonhole Sort?
Imagine you're organizing pigeons into holes 🕳️, and there's one pigeon per hole based on their "value".<br>
If you know the range of values is not too large, then this sort can do the job in O(n + range) time!

### 🔍When to Use?
- When the number of elements n ~ range of input values.
- Works great when the values are within a small, known, finite range.
