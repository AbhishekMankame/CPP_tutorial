## ðŸŽ¯Why Sorting Faster Than n log n is (usually) Impossible?

### ðŸŒŽ Imagine a Magical World...
Suppose you had n numbers.
And you want to arrange them from smallest to largest.
You think: "Dude, what if I could just start them magically in O(n)?!"ðŸ§™âœ¨
Well... sorry, you can't.
Because nature says: "You gotta work for it, my child." ðŸŒŒ

### ðŸ§  The Deep Reason: It's About <b>Information</b>
Sorting isn't just about numbers -
It's about figuring out the right order among them.

And here's the deal:
ðŸ”µ There are n! (n factorial) possible ways the numbers can be arranges.
Example:
 - 3 elements -> 6 possible orders
 - 4 elements -> 24 orders
 - 5 elements -> 120 orders
 - ...
 - 10 elements -> 3628800 ways!!! ðŸ˜±
 n! is MASSIVE even for small n.
