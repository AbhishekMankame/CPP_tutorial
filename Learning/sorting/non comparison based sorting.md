## Counting Sort: The Super Efficient Coin Sorter

Imagine this scenario... 🏦💰
You are a super-organized cashier at a mega mall (yeah, you're basically a sorting legend). Every customer who comes to your counter gives you coins of different values (1,2,3... maybe even 10!). Now, you've got a huge pile of coins and you need to sort them. But, here's the twist: You're too cool for comparisons. You don't care about comparing coins - you're just going to count how many coins of each value exist and then rearrange them. 💥✨<br>
