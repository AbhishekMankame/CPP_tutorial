## 🪣BUCKET SORT - The Pool Party of Sorting🎉🏊‍♂️
### 🎯What is Bucket Sort?
Imagine you're the boss of a massive summer pool party 🌞🏖️, and you have a crowd of guests (numbers) coming in. <br>
But OH NO!😱 They are of different heights (values). <br>
You can't just throw them all in the same pool - so you create buckets (different pools🏊‍♂️) based on their height range!
<pre>"Small kids go here, tall dudes goes there, medium bros chill over there!" 😂</pre>

- Seperate them smartly into different pools.
- Organize each pool individually.
- Bring them back together nicely in a line = Sorted Order!🔥

### 🧠Step-by-Step Real World Analogy:
1. Create Buckets ➡️ Different swimming pools for different height ranges. 🏊‍♂️🏊‍♂️
2. Scatter Guests ➡️ Short kids in Kiddie Pool, tall guys in Deep Pool 🛝🌊
3. Sort Each Bucket ➡️ Arrange guests nicely inside each pool (may be tallest to shortest inside each).📏
Merge Buckets ➡️ Form the final lineup for the Big Pool Party Photo! 📸🎉
