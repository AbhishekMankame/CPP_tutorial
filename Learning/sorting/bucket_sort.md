## 🪣BUCKET SORT - The Pool Party of Sorting🎉🏊‍♂️
### 🎯What is Bucket Sort?
Imagine you're the boss of a massive summer pool party 🌞🏖️, and you have a crowd of guests (numbers) coming in. <br>
But OH NO!😱 They are of different heights (values). <br>
You can't just throw them all in the same pool - so you create buckets (different pools🏊‍♂️) based on their height range!
<pre>"Small kids go here, tall dudes goes there, medium bros chill over there!" 😂</pre>
