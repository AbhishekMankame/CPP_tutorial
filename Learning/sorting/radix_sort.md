## 🎡 RADIX SORT: The "Digit Disco Party" 🕺
### 🧠 What's the Main Idea?
Instead of comparing numbers directly (like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort do), Radix Sort says:<br>
👉 "Bro, why stress?<br>
Let's just sort the numbers based on their individual digits... from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD)!"<br>
(Translation: Start from the rightmost digit and move left.) <br>
Imagine you have numbers like:
<pre> 170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66 </pre>
Instead of comparing numbers like 170 vs 45, we first look only at the ones place:
| Number | Ones digit |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 170 | 0 |
| 45 | 5 |
| 75 | 5 |
| 90 | 0 |
| 802 | 2 |
| 24 | 4 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 66 | 6 |

Now sort based on ones place!<br>
Then move to tens place... then hundreds place... and so on!

### 🎉Step-by-Step: The Dance Floor Moves
1. Find the maximum number - to know how many digits we need to process.<br>
(Ex: `802` -> 3 digits)
2. For each digit place (1s, 10s, 100s...):
- Apply Counting Sort based on that digit:

#### 💥Key Secret:
<pre> We must use Stable Sorting (like Counting Sort) so that order of equal digits stays same when moving to next digit!</pre>

### LIVE EXAMPLE:
Sort `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`
- Pass 1: Sort by Ones Place<br>
(numbers ending digits)

| Ones digit | Numbers |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 0 | 170, 90 |
| 2 | 802, 2 |
| 4 | 24 |
| 5 | 45, 75 |
| 6 | 66 |

After sorting by ones place:
<pre> 170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66</pre>

- Pass 2: Sort by Tens Place

| Tens digit | Numbers |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 0 | 2, 802 |
| 2 | 24 |
| 4 | 45 |
| 6 | 66 |
| 7 | 75 |
| 9 | 90 |

After sorting by tens place:
<pre> 2, 802, 24,45, 66, 75, 170, 90</pre>
