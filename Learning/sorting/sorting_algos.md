<pre> "If life feels messy, may be you just need a better sorting algorithm." 😌</pre>

### 🎯 Why Sorting Matters?
- 🧠 Search faster: Finding an element in a sorted array = rocket speed (binary search, O(log n)).
- 🚀 Simplify problems: Many DSA problems becomes 10x easier after sorting first.
- 🛠️ Foundation: Sorting is the basic building block for other advanced techniques (greedy, divide and conquer, etc.).
