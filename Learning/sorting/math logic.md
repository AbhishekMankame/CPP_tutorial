## 📚 Why You Can't Sort Faster Than O(n log n) - With Math Magic
### 1. 🎯 The Key Question
When you sort using comparisons,<br>
you are basically building a decision tree (aka a flowchart of decisions):
- Each node is a comparison ("is A < B?").
- Each branch is a yes/no answer.
- Each leaf (end of branch) is a final sorted order.

So: <br>
✔️ Each final sorted array = one leaf in the decision tree. 🌳

### 2. How Big is the Tree?
For n elements, there are exactly n! possible sorted orders.<br>
Thus, the decision tree must have at least n! leaves. <br>
(One unique leaf for every possible sorted result.)

### 3. 🔥How Tall is the Tree?
Basic rule in CS:
- In a binary decision tree (only yes/no),
- If the tree has L leaves,
- Then the minimum height(depth) is atleast:
<pre> height >= log L </pre>
Since here L = n!,<br>
thus:
<pre> height >= log (n!)</pre>
Meaning: at least log(n!) comparisons are needed in the worst case. 📈

### 4. Simplifying log(n!)
Now, using a cool math trick (Stirling's Approximation):
<pre> n! == (n^n)*(e^(-n))*(sqrt(2*pi*n)) </pre>
Taking log on both sides:
<pre> log(n!) == n log n - n log e + (1/2)log(2*pi*n) </pre>
Focus on the dominating term: <br>
✔️ n log n is WAY bigger than the other terms for large n. <br>
Thus:
<pre> log(n!) = theta(n log n) </pre>
(Theta means tightly bound - not just upper/lower)

### 5. 💥 Conclusion
- Any comparison-based sorting must do at least n log n comparisons.
- Thus, O(n) sorting by comparisons is impossible!

### 🎬 TL;DR Table
| Stop | Idea |
| ---- | ---- |
| n elements -> n! possible orders | Explosion of possibilites |
| Comparison sorting -> Binary yes/no tree |
| Tree must have >= n! leaves | Must cover all possibilites |
| Minimum height of tree = log(n!) | Number of comparisons |
| log(n!) == N log n | Thus O(n log n) minimum |
