## Recursion - When Function Call Themselves Like Narcissits
"Why do it yourself... when you can ask yourself to do it again... and again... and again?"

### ðŸŽ¬ What is Recursion?
Recursion is when a function solves a small piece of the problem... and then calls itself to solve the rest.
- It's like saying:
    - "Hey me, can you solve this?"
    - "Sure, but first let me ask me to solve it..."
