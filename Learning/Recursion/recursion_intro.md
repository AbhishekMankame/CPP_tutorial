## Recursion - When Function Call Themselves Like Narcissits
"Why do it yourself... when you can ask yourself to do it again... and again... and again?"

### 🎬 What is Recursion?
Recursion is when a function solves a small piece of the problem... and then calls itself to solve the rest.
- It's like saying:
    - "Hey me, can you solve this?"
    - "Sure, but first let me ask me to solve it..."
    - Inception music intensifies 🎵🌌

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy: Russian Dolls 🪆
Imagine you're opening a set of nested dolls:
- You open the biggest one.
- Inside is a slightly smaller one.
- Then another... until you get to the tiniest one - base case.
- Then you stack them all back up.
Recursion is exactly that. 🧠✨

### 📦 Anamoly of a Recursive Function
Every recursive function need two things:
1. Base case - When to stop calling itself.
2. Recursive case - The function calls itself with a smaller problem.
