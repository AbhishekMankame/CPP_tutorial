## 🧠 Two Pointers Technique - "Two friends solving the problems by walking across an array"
"Why use one pointer when you can double the chaos and double the speed?" 🤝💥

### 🎬 Picture this:
You've gor an array, and you want to do something smart with it - maybe find pairs, move things, or do some magical shrinking and expanding.
Instead of looping through with just one index, you say:
    "Let me call in backup." 👯
Now you have two pointers:
- One starts from the beginning ➡️
- The other starts from the end ⬅️
- Or they both start at the beginning and race across like Marion Kart 🏁🚗
