## ⚡Kadane's Algorithm - Maximum Subarray Sum
<pre> "When life throws negative numbers at you, Kadane teaches you when to let go 💁‍♂️" </pre>

### 🧠 What is Kadane's Algorithm?
Kadane's Algorithm is a beautiful and elegant solution to one of the most classic problems in computer science:
<pre>🔍Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a given array of integers (which can include negative numbers too).</pre>
This algorithm doesn't just solve the problems - it absolutely DESTROYS the brute-force methods in terms of performance.
