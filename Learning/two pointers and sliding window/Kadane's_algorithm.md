## ⚡Kadane's Algorithm - Maximum Subarray Sum
<pre> "When life throws negative numbers at you, Kadane teaches you when to let go 💁‍♂️" </pre>

### 🧠 What is Kadane's Algorithm?
Kadane's Algorithm is a beautiful and elegant solution to one of the most classic problems in computer science:
<pre>🔍Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a given array of integers (which can include negative numbers too).</pre>
This algorithm doesn't just solve the problems - it absolutely DESTROYS the brute-force methods in terms of performance.

### 💣 The Brute-Force Pain
If you try every possible subarray (like a curious brute-force caveman🔨), you'll end up doing:
- O(n^2) or even O(n^3) operations 😨
- Nested loops, recalculations, tears and regrets 😭
But Kadane says:
<pre> "Let's walk through the array once, and figure it out smartly. No drame. Just results." 🕶️
