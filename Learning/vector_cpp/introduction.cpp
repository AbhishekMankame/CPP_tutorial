// Vector
/*
- Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
- Just like arrays, vectors use contiguous storage locations for their elements, which means that their elements can also be accessed directly in O(1) time.
- But unlike arrays, their size can change dynamically, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.
