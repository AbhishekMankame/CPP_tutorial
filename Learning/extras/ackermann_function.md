## ðŸ‘¹Ackermann Function - The Titan of Recursive Functions
### ðŸ§  What is it?
The Ackermann function is a super-recursive mathematical function that grows faster than any primitive recursive function. It's used to test the limits of recursion and to analyze algorithm efficiency - like in Disjoint Set Union, where its inverse shows up.
