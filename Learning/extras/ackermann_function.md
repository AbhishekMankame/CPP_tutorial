## ðŸ‘¹Ackermann Function - The Titan of Recursive Functions
### ðŸ§  What is it?
The Ackermann function is a super-recursive mathematical function that grows faster than any primitive recursive function. It's used to test the limits of recursion and to analyze algorithm efficiency - like in Disjoint Set Union, where its inverse shows up.

### ðŸ§® Definition: 
<pre>
A(m, n) = 
    n + 1   if m == 0
    A(m - 1, 1) if m > 0 and n == 0
    A(m - 1, A(m, n - 1))   if m > 0 and n > 0
</pre>

### ðŸ¤¯ It Explodes QUICKLY
Let's see how fast it grows:
| m | n | A(m, n) |
| - | - | ------- |
| 0 | n | n + 1 |
| 1 | n | n + 2 |
| 2 | n | 2n + 3 |
| 3 | 2 | 29 |
| 4 | 1 | 65533 |
| 4 | 2 | AHHHHH ðŸ˜± |
