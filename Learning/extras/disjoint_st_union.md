## ⚔️ Disjoint Set Union (DSU) / Union-Find

### 🧠What is it?
DSU is a data structure used to track a set of elements split into disjoint (non-overlapping) groups. <br>
It answers two main questions efficiently:
1. Are two elements in the same group? (`find`)
2. Combine two groups into one. (`union`)
