### What is Time Complexity?
Time complexity describes how the run time of an algorithm grows with respect to the input size n.

#### Common time complexities (from best to worst):
| Notation   | Name           | Examples                         |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| O(1)       | Constant       | Accessing an element in an array |
| O(log n)   | Logarithmic    | Binary Search                    |
| O(n)       | Linear         | Loop through array               |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic   | Merge Sort, Heap Sort            |
| O(n^2)     | Quadratic      | Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort      |
| O(2^n)     | Exponential    | Solving Tower of Hanoi of Hanoi  |
| O(n!)      | Factorial      | Brute-force solution for Travelling Salesman |
