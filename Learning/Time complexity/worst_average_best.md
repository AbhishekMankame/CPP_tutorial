## Worst, Average and Best Case Time Complexities
It is important to analyze an algorithm after writing it to find it's efficiency in terms of time and space in order to improve it if possible.
When it comes to analyzing algorithms, the asymptotic analysis seems to be the best way possible to do so. This is because asymptotic analysis analyzes algorithms in terms of the input size.
We can have three cases to analyze an algorithm:
1. Worst Case
2. Average Case
3. Best Case
