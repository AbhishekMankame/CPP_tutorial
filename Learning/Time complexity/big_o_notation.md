### ðŸ§  Big O Notation: The Drama Queen of Computer Science
Welcome to the dazzling world of Big O Notation, where we measure how "slow" or "fast" our code is - in a fabulously exaggerated way. Think of Big O as the over-dramatic friend who doesn't care about how your code behaves sometimes - it wants to know how bad it can get when the world is on fire! ðŸ”¥

### What Even is Big O?
- Big O Notation tells you how well (or poorly) your algorithm scales with the input size.
In simpler words:
- "As your input size grows, how much more time (or space) will your code take?"

### Why Should I Care?
Because nobody likes a slow program. Imagine your app is asked to find one name in a list of a billion usres... and it responds 5 minutes later like it's had too much pizza.
Knowing Big O helps you:
- Predict performance before you run the code.
- Write code that won't cry under pressure.
- Impress interviewers and AI overlords.
