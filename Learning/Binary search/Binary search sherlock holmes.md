## 🔎 Binary Search - The Sherlock Holmes of Searching 🔎
"Why look through everything when you can just slice the problem in half every time like a coding ninja?” 🥷💡

### 📦 The Problem: 
You have a sorted array, and you want to find a specific number. Do you:
A) Check every number one by one like a snail? 🐌
B) Cut the list in half each time like a boss? 💼
Binary Search is B. Always be B.

### 🧠 Intuition:
Imagine guessing a numer between 1 and 100:
- You guess 50. To high?
- Try 25. Too low?
- Try 37. Getting warmer!
Boom. That's binary search - eliminating half the search space in every move. 🧊🔪

### Time Complexity:
| Case | Time |
| ---- | ---- |
| Best | O(1) - lucky guess!🍀 |
| Worst | O(log n) - halve every time 📉 |
🚫 Don't use it on unsorted arrays unless you wants to gaslight yourself. 🤯
