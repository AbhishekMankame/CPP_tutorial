## 🔎 Binary Search - The Sherlock Holmes of Searching 🔎
"Why look through everything when you can just slice the problem in half every time like a coding ninja?” 🥷💡

### 📦 The Problem: 
You have a sorted array, and you want to find a specific number. Do you:
A) Check every number one by one like a snail? 🐌
B) Cut the list in half each time like a boss? 💼
Binary Search is B. Always be B.
