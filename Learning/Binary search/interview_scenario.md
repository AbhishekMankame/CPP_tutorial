### In Interviews: Which to Use?
- Default to Iterative unless:
    - The interviewer specifically asks for a recursive approach
    - The problem has a recursive nature (e.g., binary trees, backtracking problems)

#### Why Iterative is Safer for Interviews
- More memory efficient (no call stack buildup)
- No stack overflow risk, even with large arrays
- Shows you're thinking about space complexity
- Most real-world production code uses the iterative version

#### When to mention Recursion?
Even if you write iterative code, it's a smart move to say:
- "This is the iterative version since it's more memory efficient, but I can also implement the recursive version if you'd like."

This shows:
- You know both approaches
- You are aware of their trade-off
- You can communicate your choices, which interviewers love
