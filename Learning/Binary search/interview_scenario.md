### In Interviews: Which to Use?
- Default to Iterative unless:
    - The interviewer specifically asks for a recursive approach
    - The problem has a recursive nature (e.g., binary trees, backtracking problems)

#### Why Iterative is Safer for Interviews
- More memory efficient (no call stack buildup)
- No stack overflow risk, even with large arrays
- Shows you're thinking about space complexity
- Most real-world production code uses the iterative version
